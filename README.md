# stackerAJAX (Thinkful Project)
Learn jQuery AJAX Patterns

This project created a simple app that works with the StackExchange API (StackExchange is the umbrella organization of which StackOverflow is a part). This will make it easy for users to immediately find open questions about topics they’re familiar with. The app will help you and your fellow learners pounce on new questions before anyone else can. Specifically, it will let us see how recent the question is, the title, and the reputation points of the person who asked it. As a beginner, you’re probably best suited to answer new questions by other beginners (who will also have low reputation).


<h1>Goals</h1>
 - Gain exprience building an app that updates DOM with data retrieved through AJAX request.
 - Get to know the jQuery AJAX API better
